            The growth and impact of social network resulted not only in huge
            collection of data but also as a reliable source of data to draw
            valuable information from. Twitter, one of the major social
            platforms is used for collection of tweets related to a disaster.
            The tweets are written by the people in an area who are affected by
            a particular disaster for multiple reasons: to seek help, to express
            grief or to show the seriousness of the situation. Some tweets are
            also written by the non-local people to bring awareness. These
            tweets are identified by the hashtags and collected for further
            analysis and classification of tweets as original or hoax. The
            method discussed in this paper is bidirectional long short-term
            memory to classify tweets and obtain accuracy of 88 percent.

            An Overview to the computer vision algorithms used for facial
            recognition. The main article idea is to explore an algorithm which
            can be used in biometric attendance systems with suitable methods
            and available inputs. The algorithm mainly uses histogram-oriented
            gradients for finding the faces, estimation of face landmarks,
            support vector machine to recognize the face and Deep convolutional
            networks to compare faces. The basis and scientific procedure for
            facial recognition is described in the article. A basic application
            is also developed in order to mark the time of the face appears is
            .csv format and attendance is marked. The article mainly uses dlib
            and face_recognition libraries in order to provide the
            functionality.
